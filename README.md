# TD Bash Scripts

These contains the bash scripts that I use on my Linux Mint device for deranking and trading multiple accounts.

Trading.sh - open multiple instances of Steam Client using different user spaces. Useful for trading within accounts.
Deranker.sh - open multiple instances of Counter-Strike:Global Offensive. Currently incomplete/inoperational. Will be fixed ASAP
